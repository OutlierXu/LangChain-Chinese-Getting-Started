# 如何组合代理和向量存储

本笔记介绍如何组合代理和vectorstore。这种情况的用例是，您已经将数据输入到vectorstore中，并希望以代理方式与之交互。

推荐的方法是创建一个RetrievalQA，然后将其用作整个代理中的工具。让我们来看看下面是怎么做的。您可以使用多个不同的vectordb来实现这一点，并使用代理作为在它们之间路由。有两种不同的方法可以做到这一点-你可以让代理使用vectorstores作为正常的工具，或者你可以设置 `return_direct=True` 真正只是使用代理作为路由器。

# 创建矢量存储

```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

from pathlib import Path
relevant_parts = []
for p in Path(".").absolute().parts:
    relevant_parts.append(p)
    if relevant_parts[-3:] == ["langchain", "docs", "modules"]:
        break
doc_path = str(Path(*relevant_parts) / "state_of_the_union.txt")


from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader(doc_path)
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
docsearch = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings, collection_name="state-of-union")

```

```python
Running Chroma using direct local API.
Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.
```

```python
state_of_union = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())
```

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
```

```python
loader = WebBaseLoader("https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/")
```

```python
docs = loader.load()
ruff_texts = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
ruff_db = Chroma.from_documents(ruff_texts, embeddings, collection_name="ruff")
ruff = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=ruff_db.as_retriever())
```

```python
Running Chroma using direct local API.
Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.
```

## 创建代理
```python
# Import things that are needed generically
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.tools import BaseTool
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain import LLMMathChain, SerpAPIWrapper

tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "State of Union QA System",
        func=state_of_union.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about the most recent state of the union address. Input should be a fully formed question."
    ),
    Tool(
        name = "Ruff QA System",
        func=ruff.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about ruff (a python linter). Input should be a fully formed question."
    ),
]
```

```python
# Construct the agent. We will use the default agent type here.
# See documentation for a full list of options.
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)
```

```python
agent.run("What did biden say about ketanji brown jackson is the state of the union address?")
```

```python
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 I need to find out what Biden said about Ketanji Brown Jackson in the State of the Union address.
Action: State of Union QA System
Action Input: What did Biden say about Ketanji Brown Jackson in the State of the Union address?
Observation:  Biden said that Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds and that she will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence.
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: Biden said that Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds and that she will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence.

```python
"Biden said that Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds and that she will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence."
```

```python
agent.run("Why use ruff over flake8?")
```

```python
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 I need to find out the advantages of using ruff over flake8
Action: Ruff QA System
Action Input: What are the advantages of using ruff over flake8?
Observation:  Ruff can be used as a drop-in replacement for Flake8 when used (1) without or with a small number of plugins, (2) alongside Black, and (3) on Python 3 code. It also re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code quality tools natively, including isort, yesqa, eradicate, and most of the rules implemented in pyupgrade. Ruff also supports automatically fixing its own lint violations, which Flake8 does not.

## 仅将代理用作路由器

如果您打算将代理用作路由器，并且只想直接返回RetrievalQAChain的结果，您也可以设置 `return_direct=True` 。

请注意，在上面的示例中，代理在查询RetrievalQAChain之后做了一些额外的工作。您可以避免这种情况，直接返回结果。

```python
tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "State of Union QA System",
        func=state_of_union.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about the most recent state of the union address. Input should be a fully formed question.",
        return_direct=True
    ),
    Tool(
        name = "Ruff QA System",
        func=ruff.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about ruff (a python linter). Input should be a fully formed question.",
        return_direct=True
    ),
]


agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)


agent.run("What did biden say about ketanji brown jackson in the state of the union address?")

```

```pycon

## 多跳问题vectorstore推理

多跳问题 ：用户的问题涉及到知识图谱中多个节点组成的路径，例如“XX酒店的游泳池几点开”，需要我们在图谱中先后找到酒店、游泳池、营业时间。

因为VectorStore很容易用作代理中的工具，所以使用现有的代理框架很容易回答依赖于VectorStore的多跳问题


```python
tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "State of Union QA System",
        func=state_of_union.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about the most recent state of the union address. Input should be a fully formed question, not referencing any obscure pronouns from the conversation before."
    ),
    Tool(
        name = "Ruff QA System",
        func=ruff.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about ruff (a python linter). Input should be a fully formed question, not referencing any obscure pronouns from the conversation before."

agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)


agent.run("What tool does ruff use to run over Jupyter Notebooks? Did the president mention that tool in the state of the union?")
```

```python
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 I need to find out what tool ruff uses to run over Jupyter Notebooks, and if the president mentioned it in the state of the union.
Action: Ruff QA System
Action Input: What tool does ruff use to run over Jupyter Notebooks?
Observation:  Ruff is integrated into nbQA, a tool for running linters and code formatters over Jupyter Notebooks. After installing ruff and nbqa, you can run Ruff over a notebook like so: > nbqa ruff Untitled.ipynb
Thought: I now need to find out if the president mentioned this tool in the state of the union.
Action: State of Union QA System
Action Input: Did the president mention nbQA in the state of the union?
Observation:  No, the president did not mention nbQA in the state of the union.
Thought: I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: No, the president did not mention nbQA in the state of the union.
