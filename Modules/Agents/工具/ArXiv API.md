# ArXiv API工具

这个笔记介绍了如何使用 `arxiv` 组件。

首先，你需要安装 `arxiv` python包。

```bash
!pip install arxiv
```

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent, AgentType

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
tools = load_tools(
    ["arxiv"], 
)

agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)
```

```python
agent_chain.run(
    "What's the paper 1605.08386 about?",
)
```

```python

I need to use Arxiv to search for the paper.

Title: Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases
Authors: Caprice Stanley, Tobias Windisch
Summary: Graphs on lattice points are studied whose edges come from a finite set of
allowed moves of arbitrary length. We show that the diameter of these graphs on
fibers of a fixed integer matrix can be bounded from above by a constant. We
then study the mixing behaviour of heat-bath random walks on these graphs. We
also state explicit conditions on the set of moves so that the heat-bath random
walk, a generalization of the Glauber dynamics, is an expander in fixed
dimension.
Thought:The paper is about heat-bath random walks with Markov bases on graphs of lattice points.
Final Answer: The paper 1605.08386 is about heat-bath random walks with Markov bases on graphs of lattice points.

## The ArXiv API Wrapper

该工具包装API包装器。下面，我们可以探索它提供的一些功能。

```python
from langchain.utilities import ArxivAPIWrapper
```
运行查询以获取有关某些 `scientific article` /文章的信息。查询文本限制为300个字符。它返回以下文章字段：
- Publishing date
- Title
- Authors
- Summary

下一个查询返回关于arxiv Id等于“1605.08386”的一篇文章的信息。

```python
arxiv = ArxivAPIWrapper()
docs = arxiv.run("1605.08386")
docs
```

```python
'Published: 2016-05-26\nTitle: Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases\nAuthors: Caprice Stanley, Tobias Windisch\nSummary: Graphs on lattice points are studied whose edges come from a finite set of\nallowed moves of arbitrary length.

```

现在，我们想要获取关于一个作者的信息， `Caprice Stanley` 。

此查询返回有关三篇文章的信息。默认情况下，查询仅返回有关的三篇热门文章的信息。

```python
docs = arxiv.run("Caprice Stanley")

Fourier analysis provides explicit formulas to compute the\neigenvalues of the transition matrices and we use this to bound the mixing time\nof the random walks.\n\nPublished: 2016-05-26\nTitle: Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases\nAuthors: Caprice Stanley, Tobias Windisch\nSummary: Graphs on lattice points are studied whose edges come from a finite set of\nallowed moves of arbitrary length.

An\nagreement of calculated fluxes with data on charged particles from the AMS and\nCAPRICE detectors is demonstrated. Predictions on neutrino fluxes at different\nexperimental sites are compared with results from other calculations.'
