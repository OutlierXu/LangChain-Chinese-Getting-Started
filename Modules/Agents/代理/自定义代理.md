# Custom Agent 自定义代理

本笔记将介绍如何创建自己的定制代理。

一个代理由两部分组成：
```pycon
- Tools: The tools the agent has available to use.
- The agent class itself: this decides which action to take.
```

在本笔记中，我们将介绍如何创建定制代理。

```python
from langchain.agents import Tool, AgentExecutor, BaseSingleActionAgent
from langchain import OpenAI, SerpAPIWrapper



search = SerpAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events",
        return_direct=True
    )
]
```

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Any, Union
from langchain.schema import AgentAction, AgentFinish

class FakeAgent(BaseSingleActionAgent):
    """Fake Custom Agent."""
    
    @property
    def input_keys(self):
        return ["input"]
    
    def plan(
        self, intermediate_steps: List[Tuple[AgentAction, str]], **kwargs: Any
    ) -> Union[AgentAction, AgentFinish]:
        """Given input, decided what to do.

        Args:
            intermediate_steps: Steps the LLM has taken to date,
                along with observations
            **kwargs: User inputs.

        Returns:
            Action specifying what tool to use.
        """
        return AgentAction(tool="Search", tool_input=kwargs["input"], log="")

    async def aplan(
        self, intermediate_steps: List[Tuple[AgentAction, str]], **kwargs: Any
    ) -> Union[AgentAction, AgentFinish]:
        """Given input, decided what to do.

        Args:
            intermediate_steps: Steps the LLM has taken to date,
                along with observations
            **kwargs: User inputs.

        Returns:
            Action specifying what tool to use.
        """
        return AgentAction(tool="Search", tool_input=kwargs["input"], log="")
```

```python
agent = FakeAgent()


agent_executor = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)


agent_executor.run("How many people live in canada as of 2023?")
```

```python
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
The current population of Canada is 38,669,152 as of Monday, April 24, 2023, based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data.

> Finished chain.
```

```python
'The current population of Canada is 38,669,152 as of Monday, April 24, 2023, based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data.'
